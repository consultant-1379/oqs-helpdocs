          The OpenStack Queuing Solution (OQS) is a tool that is used to handle
          the queuing of Deployment CI/CD pipelines within their
          respective OpenStack multi-tenant Cloud (Pod) environments.
        </p>
        <p>
          OQS is sent basic information (name, job-type, product and associated Pod) on Deployments
          performing software deployment through the OQS API.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once this information is sent, OQS adds the Deployment to the queue
          within its associated Pod. If there are no active Pods, the Deployment's
          queue-status becomes "Active". Once the Deployment CI/CD pipeline is complete
          the queue-status of the Deployment becomes "Finished". The next Deployment CI/CD
          pipeline in the queue will now be set to "Active".
        </p>
        <p>
          The purpose of the tool is to allow administrators to configure
          specific queuing for each individual Pod, as well as provide
          a Radiator-View interface for users to analyse the queuing information
          for every Pod.
        </p>
        <p>
          The result is an improved queuing solution for Deployments, more
          advanced administration abilities for Pod queue-handling, as well as
          a more easily digested view of the queue-status for individual
          Deployments within each Pod.
